"100 TRIAL OVERVIEW",
"101. Part-A ¦ To assist you in your tasks as jurors¸ I will now explain how the trial will proceed. I will begin by identifying the parties to the case. [Name of plaintiff] filed this lawsuit. [He/She/It] is called a plaintiff. [He/She/It] seeks damages [or other relief] from [name of defendant]¸ who is called a defendant. · [[Name of plaintiff] claims [insert description of the plaintiff’s claim(s)]. [Name of defendant] denies those claims. [[Name of defendant] also contends that [insert description of the defendant’s aff?rmative defense(s)].]] · [[Name of cross-complainant] has also filed what is called a cross complaint against [name of cross-defendant]. [Name of cross-complainant] is the defendant¸ but also is called the cross-complainant. [Name of cross-defendant] is called a cross-defendant.] · [In [his/her/its] cross-complaint¸ [name of cross-complainant] claims [insert description of the cross-complainant’s claim(s)]. [Name of cross- defendant] denies those claims. [[Name of cross-defendant] also contends that [insert description of the cross-defendant’s aff?rmative defense(s) to the cross-complaint].]] · First¸ each side may make an opening statement¸ but neither side is required to do so. An opening statement is not evidence. It is simply an outline to help you understand what that party expects the evidence will show. · ",
"101. Part-B ¦ Also¸ because it is often difficult to give you the evidence in the order we would prefer¸ the opening statement allows you to keep an overview of the case in mind during the presentation of the evidence. · Next¸ the jury will hear the evidence. [Name of plaintiff] will present evidence first. When [name of plaintiff] is finished¸ [name of defendant] will have an opportunity to present evidence. [Then [name of cross- complainant] will present evidence. Finally¸ [name of cross-defendant] will present evidence.] · Each witness will first be questioned by the side that asked the witness to testify. This is called direct examination. Then the other side is permitted to question the witness. This is called cross-examination. · Documents or objects referred to during the trial are called exhibits. Exhibits are given a [number/letter] so that they may be clearly identified. Exhibits are not evidence until I admit them into evidence. During your deliberations¸ you will be able to look at all exhibits admitted into evidence. · There are many rules that govern whether something will be admitted into evidence. As one side presents evidence¸ the other side has the right to object and to ask me to decide if the evidence is permitted by the rules. Usually¸ I will decide immediately¸ but sometimes I may have to hear arguments outside of your presence. · After the evidence has been presented¸ I will instruct you on the law that applies to the case and the attorneys will make closing arguments. What the parties say in closing argument is not evidence. The arguments are offered to help you understand the evidence and how the law applies to it. ¤¦",
"200 ADMINISTRATION AND EVIDENCE",
"200. ¦ A party must persuade you¸ by the evidence presented in court¸ that what he or she is required to prove is more likely to be true than not true. This is referred to as ¨the burden of proof.¨ · After weighing all of the evidence¸ if you cannot decide that something is more likely to be true than not true¸ you must conclude that the party did not prove it. You should consider all the evidence¸ no matter which party produced the evidence. · In criminal trials¸ the prosecution must prove that the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. But in civil trials¸ such as this one¸ the party who is required to prove something need prove only that it is more likely to be true than not true. ¤¦",
"201. ¦ Certain facts must be proved by clear and convincing evidence¸ which is a higher burden of proof. This means the party must persuade you that it is highly probable that the fact is true. I will tell you specifically which facts must be proved by clear and convincing evidence. ¤¦",
"202. ¦ Evidence can come in many forms. It can be testimony about what someone saw or heard or smelled. It can be an exhibit admitted into evidence. It can be someone’s opinion. · Direct evidence can prove a fact by itself. For example¸ if a witness testifies she saw a jet plane flying across the sky¸ that testimony is direct evidence that a plane flew across the sky. Some evidence proves a fact indirectly. For example¸ a witness testifies that he saw only the white trail that jet planes often leave. This indirect evidence is sometimes referred to as ¨circumstantial evidence.¨ In either instance¸ the witness’s testimony is evidence that a jet plane flew across the sky. · As far as the law is concerned¸ it makes no difference whether evidence is direct or indirect. You may choose to believe or disbelieve either kind. Whether it is direct or indirect¸ you should give every piece of evidence whatever weight you think it deserves. ¤¦",
"203. ¦ You may consider the ability of each party to provide evidence. If a party provided weaker evidence when it could have provided stronger evidence¸ you may distrust the weaker evidence. ¤¦",

Whenever I tell you the People must prove something¸ I mean they must prove it beyond a reasonable doubt [unless I specifically tell you otherwise]. · Proof beyond a reasonable doubt is proof that leaves you with an abiding conviction that the charge is true. The evidence need not eliminate all possible doubt because everything in life is open to some possible or imaginary doubt. · In deciding whether the People have proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt¸ you must impartially compare and consider all the evidence that was received throughout the entire trial.

In their opening statements and closing arguments¸ the attorneys will discuss the case¸ but their remarks are not evidence. Their questions are not evidence. Only the witnesses’ answers are evidence.

Consider the testimony of each witness and decide how much of it you believe. · In evaluating a witness’s testimony¸ you may consider anything that reasonably tends to prove or disprove the truth or accuracy of that testimony. Among the factors that you may consider are: · --  How well could the witness see¸ hear¸ or otherwise perceive the things about which the witness testified -- · --  How well was the witness able to remember and describe what happened -- · --  What was the witness’s behavior while testifying -- · --  Did the witness understand the questions and answer them directly -- · --  Was the witness’s testimony influenced by a factor such as bias or prejudice¸ a personal relationship with someone involved in the case¸ or a personal interest in how the case is decided -- · --  What was the witness’s attitude about the case or about testifying -- · --  Did the witness make a statement in the past that is consistent or inconsistent with his or her testimony -- · ",

Consider whether the differences are important or not. People sometimes honestly forget things or make mistakes about what they remember. Also¸ two people may witness the same event yet see or hear it differently. · [If the evidence establishes that a witness’s character for truthfulness has not been discussed among the people who know him or her¸ you may conclude from the lack of discussion that the witness’s character for truthfulness is good.] · [If you do not believe a witness’s testimony that he or she no longer remembers something¸ that testimony is inconsistent with the witness’s earlier statement on that subject.] · [If you decide that a witness deliberately lied about something significant in this case¸ you should consider not believing anything that witness says.

Circumstantial evidence does not directly prove the fact to be decided¸ but is evidence of another fact or group of facts from which you may logically and reasonably conclude the truth of the fact in question. For example¸ if a witness testifies that he saw someone come inside wearing a raincoat covered with drops of water¸ that testimony is circumstantial evidence because it may support a conclusion that it was raining outside. · Both direct and circumstantial evidence are acceptable types of evidence to prove or disprove the elements of a charge¸ including intent and mental state and acts necessary to a conviction¸ and neither is necessarily more reliable than the other.
