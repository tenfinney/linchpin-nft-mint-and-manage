  "legalElement1": "101. Part-A ¦ To assist you in your tasks as jurors¸ I will now explain how the trial will proceed. I will begin by identifying the parties to the case. [Name of plaintiff] filed this lawsuit. [He/She/It] is called a plaintiff. [He/She/It] seeks damages [or other relief] from [name of defendant]¸ who is called a defendant. · [[Name of plaintiff] claims [insert description of the plaintiff’s claim(s)]. [Name of defendant] denies those claims. [[Name of defendant] also contends that [insert description of the defendant’s aff?rmative defense(s)].]] · [[Name of cross-complainant] has also filed what is called a cross complaint against [name of cross-defendant]. [Name of cross-complainant] is the defendant¸ but also is called the cross-complainant. [Name of cross-defendant] is called a cross-defendant.] · [In [his/her/its] cross-complaint¸ [name of cross-complainant] claims [insert description of the cross-complainant’s claim(s)]. [Name of cross- defendant] denies those claims. [[Name of cross-defendant] also contends that [insert description of the cross-defendant’s aff?rmative defense(s) to the cross-complaint].]] · First¸ each side may make an opening statement¸ but neither side is required to do so. An opening statement is not evidence. It is simply an outline to help you understand what that party expects the evidence will show. · ",
  "legalElement10": "207. ¦ [During the trial¸ I explained that certain evidence could be considered as to only one party. You may not consider that evidence as to any other party.] · [During the trial¸ I explained that certain evidence could be considered as to one or more parties but not to every party. You may not consider that evidence as to any other party.] ¤¦",
  "legalElement2": "101. Part-B ¦ Also¸ because it is often difficult to give you the evidence in the order we would prefer¸ the opening statement allows you to keep an overview of the case in mind during the presentation of the evidence. · Next¸ the jury will hear the evidence. [Name of plaintiff] will present evidence first. When [name of plaintiff] is finished¸ [name of defendant] will have an opportunity to present evidence. [Then [name of cross- complainant] will present evidence. Finally¸ [name of cross-defendant] will present evidence.] · Each witness will first be questioned by the side that asked the witness to testify. This is called direct examination. Then the other side is permitted to question the witness. This is called cross-examination. · Documents or objects referred to during the trial are called exhibits. Exhibits are given a [number/letter] so that they may be clearly identified. Exhibits are not evidence until I admit them into evidence. During your deliberations¸ you will be able to look at all exhibits admitted into evidence. · There are many rules that govern whether something will be admitted into evidence. As one side presents evidence¸ the other side has the right to object and to ask me to decide if the evidence is permitted by the rules. Usually¸ I will decide immediately¸ but sometimes I may have to hear arguments outside of your presence. · After the evidence has been presented¸ I will instruct you on the law that applies to the case and the attorneys will make closing arguments. What the parties say in closing argument is not evidence. The arguments are offered to help you understand the evidence and how the law applies to it. ¤¦",
  "legalElement3": "200. ¦ A party must persuade you¸ by the evidence presented in court¸ that what he or she is required to prove is more likely to be true than not true. This is referred to as ¨the burden of proof.¨ · After weighing all of the evidence¸ if you cannot decide that something is more likely to be true than not true¸ you must conclude that the party did not prove it. You should consider all the evidence¸ no matter which party produced the evidence. · In criminal trials¸ the prosecution must prove that the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. But in civil trials¸ such as this one¸ the party who is required to prove something need prove only that it is more likely to be true than not true. ¤¦",
  "legalElement4": "201. ¦ Certain facts must be proved by clear and convincing evidence¸ which is a higher burden of proof. This means the party must persuade you that it is highly probable that the fact is true. I will tell you specifically which facts must be proved by clear and convincing evidence. ¤¦",
  "legalElement5": "202. ¦ Evidence can come in many forms. It can be testimony about what someone saw or heard or smelled. It can be an exhibit admitted into evidence. It can be someone’s opinion. · Direct evidence can prove a fact by itself. For example¸ if a witness testifies she saw a jet plane flying across the sky¸ that testimony is direct evidence that a plane flew across the sky. Some evidence proves a fact indirectly. For example¸ a witness testifies that he saw only the white trail that jet planes often leave. This indirect evidence is sometimes referred to as ¨circumstantial evidence.¨ In either instance¸ the witness’s testimony is evidence that a jet plane flew across the sky. · As far as the law is concerned¸ it makes no difference whether evidence is direct or indirect. You may choose to believe or disbelieve either kind. Whether it is direct or indirect¸ you should give every piece of evidence whatever weight you think it deserves. ¤¦",
  "legalElement6": "203. ¦ You may consider the ability of each party to provide evidence. If a party provided weaker evidence when it could have provided stronger evidence¸ you may distrust the weaker evidence. ¤¦",
  "legalElement7": "204. ¦ You may consider whether one party intentionally concealed or destroyed evidence. If you decide that a party did so¸ you may decide that the evidence would have been unfavorable to that party. ¤¦",
  "legalElement8": "205. ¦ If a party failed to explain or deny evidence against [him/her/it] when [he/she/it] could reasonably be expected to have done so based on what [he/she/it] knew¸ you may consider [his/her/its] failure to explain or deny in evaluating that evidence. · It is up to you to decide the meaning and importance of the failure to explain or deny evidence against the party. ¤¦",
  "legalElement9": "206. ¦ During the trial¸ I explained to you that certain evidence was admitted for a limited purpose. You may consider that evidence only for the limited purpose that I described¸ and not for any other purpose. ¤¦",
